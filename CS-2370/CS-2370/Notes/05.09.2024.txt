Compiler vs interpreter
Compiler
Book ->translated ->translated book
very rigid, but loads quickly.
Interpreter
person -> translator -> person
very dynamic, but takes more processing poswer to use and stuff.
#include-
includes someone elses code from a library, which is a bunch of code people will use commonly.
namespaces specify groups of objects (things with attributes)
example- lets you use cout without typing std::cout
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
   
}
